# `Learn React With Harshi` Series 
   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini
## Class Summary `Chapter-15 Building Advanced Features` (12/02/2023)
  
  This chapter is the continuation of the app that we discussed in last chapter. In the first half, we implemented advanced features like searching, how to improve app performance using debouncing, caching and Integration. Second half, we understood how to implement nested comments features. I am enhancing my app `YouTube-Clone` with this knowledge. Check out [YouTube-Clone](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/youtube-clone) repository to check the code for this app.

  Check [features.md](https://github.com/chapter-14-machine-coding-interview/blob/main/features.md) for all the features that I implemented in the app `youtube-Clone`.

One line about this chapter : `Don't think what a single extra line of code can do to your app, it can imporve app performance by 5X, it can even reduce 14000 API requests to just 3000 API reuests`

Check out [YouTube-Clone Live](https://learn-react-with-harshi-youtube-clone.netlify.app/) for the live demo of the app `YouTube-Clone`. Also check out the next chapter to see how YouTube-Clone has progressed. Happy Reacting !!!
